<p style="text-align: center;" >"A cloud-based application for on-demand generation of a clinical mammographic 
image database with different radiation doses and breast lesions."</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"> Currently, this system has 100 mammographic images without lesions provided by the Barretos Cancer Hospital.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">From the pool of these 100 images, <i>N</i> new images can be generated on demand according to user-selected characteristics.
  These characteristics may include generating mammograms with clusters of microcalcifications, adjusting the quantity and contrast of lesions,
  and simulating the level of radiation dose at which the image was acquired.</p>
